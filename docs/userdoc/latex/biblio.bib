	abstract = {This paper presents a content-based approach for understanding handball videos. Tracked players are characterized by their 2D trajectories in the court plane. The trajectories and their interactions are used to model visual semantics, i.e., the observed activity phases. To this end, hierarchical parallel semi-Markov models (HPaSMMs) are computed in order to take into account the temporal causalities of object motions. Players motions are characterized using velocity informations while their interactions are described by the distances between trajectories. We have evaluated our method on real video sequences, and have favorably compared with another method, i.e., hierarchical parallel hidden Markov models (HPaHMMs).},

	abstract = {In conventional wisdom of video modeling, the background is often treated as the primary target and foreground is derived using the technique of background subtraction. Based on the observation that foreground and background are two sides of the same coin, we propose to treat them as peer unknown variables and formulate a joint estimation problem, called Hierarchical modeling and Alternating Optimization (HMAO). The motivation behind our hierarchical extensions of background and foreground models is to better incorporate a priori knowledge about the disparity between background and foreground. For background, we decompose it into temporally low-frequency and high-frequency components for the purpose of better characterizing the class of video with dynamic background; for foreground, we construct a Markov random field prior at a spatially low resolution as the pivot to facilitate the noise-resilient refinement at higher resolutions. Built on hierarchical extensions of both models, we show how to successively refine their joint estimates under a unified framework known as alternating direction multipliers method. Experimental results have shown that our approach produces more discriminative background and demonstrates better robustness to noise than other competing methods. When compared against current state-of-the-art techniques, HMAO achieves at least comparable and often superior performance in terms of F-measure scores, especially for video containing dynamic and complex background.},

	abstract = {In current robotics research there is a vast body of work on algorithms and control methods for groups of decentralized cooperating robots, called a swarm or collective. These algorithms are generally meant to control collectives of hundreds or even thousands of robots; however, for reasons of cost, time, or complexity, they are generally validated in simulation only, or on a group of a few tens of robots. To address this issue, this paper presents Kilobot, a low-cost robot designed to make testing collective algorithms on hundreds or thousands of robots accessible to robotics researchers. To enable the possibility of large Kilobot collectives where the number of robots is an order of magnitude larger than the largest that exist today, each robot is made with only \$14 worth of parts and takes 5 minutes to assemble. Furthermore, the robot design allows a single user to easily operate a large Kilobot collective, such as programming, powering on, and charging all robots, which would be difficult or impossible to do with many existing robotic systems.},

	abstract = {Working with large swarms of robots has challenges in calibration, sensing, tracking, and control due to the associated scalability and time requirements. Kilobots solve this through their ease of maintenance and programming, and are widely used in several research laboratories worldwide where their low cost enables large-scale swarms studies. However, the small, inexpensive nature of the Kilobots limits their range of capabilities as they are only equipped with a single sensor. In some studies, this limitation can be a source of motivation and inspiration, while in others it is an impediment. As such, we designed, implemented, and tested a novel system to communicate personalized location-and-state-based information to each robot, and receive information on each robots' state. In this way, the Kilobots can sense additional information from a virtual environment in real time; for example, a value on a gradient, a direction toward a reference point or a pheromone trail. The augmented reality for Kilobots (ARK) system implements this in flexible base control software which allows users to define varying virtual environments within a single experiment using integrated overhead tracking and control. We showcase the different functionalities of the system through three demos involving hundreds of Kilobots. The ARK provides Kilobots with additional and unique capabilities through an open-source tool which can be implemented with inexpensive, off-the-shelf hardware.},

	abstract = {The Kilobot is a widely used platform for investigation of swarm robotics. Physical Kilobots are slow moving and require frequent recalibration and charging, which significantly slows down the development cycle. Simulators can speed up the process of testing, exploring and hypothesis generation, but usually require time consuming and error-prone translation of code between simulator and robot. Moreover, code of different nature often obfuscates direct comparison, as well as determination of the cause of deviation, between simulator and actual robot swarm behaviour. To tackle these issues we have developed a C-based simulator that allows those working with Kilobots to use the same programme code in both the simulator and the physical robots. Use of our simulator, coined Kilombo, significantly simplifies and speeds up development, given that a simulation of 1000 robots can be run at a speed 100 times faster than real time on a desktop computer, making high-throughput pre-screening possible of potential algorithms that could lead to desired emergent behaviour. We argue that this strategy, here specifically developed for Kilobots, is of general importance for effective robot swarm research. The source code is freely available under the MIT license.},

It uses self-attention to iteratively reason about the relations between entities in a scene and to guide a model-free policy. Our results show that in a novel navigation and planning task called Box-World, our agent finds interpretable solutions that improve upon baselines in terms of sample complexity, ability to generalize to more complex scenes than experienced during training, and overall performance. In the StarCraft II Learning Environment, our agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on six mini-games -- surpassing human grandmaster performance on four. By considering architectural inductive biases, our work opens new directions for overcoming important, but stubborn, challenges in deep RL.},

In this paper, we analyze the literature from the point of view of swarm engineering: we focus mainly on ideas and concepts that contribute to the advancement of swarm robotics as an engineering field and that could be relevant to tackle real-world applications. Swarm engineering is an emerging discipline that aims at defining systematic and well founded procedures for modeling, designing, realizing, verifying, validating, operating, and maintaining a swarm robotics system. We propose two taxonomies: in the first taxonomy, we classify works that deal with design and analysis methods; in the second taxonomy, we classify works according to the collective behavior studied. We conclude with a discussion of the current limits of swarm robotics as an engineering discipline and with suggestions for future research directions.},
