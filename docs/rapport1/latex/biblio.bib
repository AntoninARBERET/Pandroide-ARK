	abstract = {In current robotics research there is a vast body of work on algorithms and control methods for groups of decentralized cooperating robots, called a swarm or collective. These algorithms are generally meant to control collectives of hundreds or even thousands of robots; however, for reasons of cost, time, or complexity, they are generally validated in simulation only, or on a group of a few tens of robots. To address this issue, this paper presents Kilobot, a low-cost robot designed to make testing collective algorithms on hundreds or thousands of robots accessible to robotics researchers. To enable the possibility of large Kilobot collectives where the number of robots is an order of magnitude larger than the largest that exist today, each robot is made with only \$14 worth of parts and takes 5 minutes to assemble. Furthermore, the robot design allows a single user to easily operate a large Kilobot collective, such as programming, powering on, and charging all robots, which would be difficult or impossible to do with many existing robotic systems.},

	abstract = {Working with large swarms of robots has challenges in calibration, sensing, tracking, and control due to the associated scalability and time requirements. Kilobots solve this through their ease of maintenance and programming, and are widely used in several research laboratories worldwide where their low cost enables large-scale swarms studies. However, the small, inexpensive nature of the Kilobots limits their range of capabilities as they are only equipped with a single sensor. In some studies, this limitation can be a source of motivation and inspiration, while in others it is an impediment. As such, we designed, implemented, and tested a novel system to communicate personalized location-and-state-based information to each robot, and receive information on each robots' state. In this way, the Kilobots can sense additional information from a virtual environment in real time; for example, a value on a gradient, a direction toward a reference point or a pheromone trail. The augmented reality for Kilobots (ARK) system implements this in flexible base control software which allows users to define varying virtual environments within a single experiment using integrated overhead tracking and control. We showcase the different functionalities of the system through three demos involving hundreds of Kilobots. The ARK provides Kilobots with additional and unique capabilities through an open-source tool which can be implemented with inexpensive, off-the-shelf hardware.},

	shorttitle = {Kilombo},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04285},
	abstract = {The Kilobot is a widely used platform for investigation of swarm robotics. Physical Kilobots are slow moving and require frequent recalibration and charging, which significantly slows down the development cycle. Simulators can speed up the process of testing, exploring and hypothesis generation, but usually require time consuming and error-prone translation of code between simulator and robot. Moreover, code of different nature often obfuscates direct comparison, as well as determination of the cause of deviation, between simulator and actual robot swarm behaviour. To tackle these issues we have developed a C-based simulator that allows those working with Kilobots to use the same programme code in both the simulator and the physical robots. Use of our simulator, coined Kilombo, significantly simplifies and speeds up development, given that a simulation of 1000 robots can be run at a speed 100 times faster than real time on a desktop computer, making high-throughput pre-screening possible of potential algorithms that could lead to desired emergent behaviour. We argue that this strategy, here specifically developed for Kilobots, is of general importance for effective robot swarm research. The source code is freely available under the MIT license.},

One property of a robotic collective that allows it to complete  such a task is the shape of the collective. This paper presents Kilobot, a  simple modular robot designed to work  in a collective to self-assemble and self-heal that collective’s shape. In previous work, an algorithm is given that allows a simulated collective of robots to self-assemble and self-heal a desired shape, keeping the shape sized proportional to the number of robots in the collective. In this abstract, the current work of producing a robotic collective that can demonstrate that algorithm is presented.},
